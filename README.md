# sql_for_data_scientists_coursera
This repository contains SQL query (written in SQLite) for the "SQL for Data Scientists" MOOC offered in coursera, by UC Davis.
The queries used here granted me 100% of the grade. The queries are not for copying - pasting, but they could serve as a training / 
learning code for other students.
